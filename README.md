# Game of Thrones  Memory Game

This is a React.js game that  renders different images of the show characters to the screen.
The game goal is not to click on the same image more than once(max possible score is 12, aka the number of images)
It keeps track of the user's score. The user's score goes up when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score  resets to 0 if a user clicks the same image more than once.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page  shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game  restarts.
